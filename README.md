# What is this project?

This project is a direct continue to Ex_0 #https://github.com/ArikTatievski/OOP_Ex_0/tree/master/ex0

This time we have programmed it as an offline algorithm using Python.

# The way we made our project:

We have made a few classes these next lines will explain them.

Building/Elevator/CallForElevator - are 3 low-key classes that know how to do the most basic functions.(Creating a building, setting up the elevator settings etc..)

MyAlgo - This is the main class that knows to accept a json file of calls(We mentioned its an offline elevator), and it allocates all the calls for elevators using the time stamp.

In fact what we did is take our "offline conditions" and turn it into "online comditions" this way we promise the best results.

# How did we test our project?

In every step and every function we made we did all the tests on the extreme conditions of the elevators to make sure all the allocations are being made properly


Hope you find good usuage of this project!
